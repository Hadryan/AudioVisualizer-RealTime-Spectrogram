# RealTime-AudioVisualizer-Spectrogram
This is a small JavaFX desktop application for real-time audio visualization (spectrogram) built from scratch.

## Overview
The application supports visualization and playback of .wav files, or it can directly visualize microphone input.
<br>The audio is visually represented with a spectrogram. A spectrogram is a picture where the X coordinate of a pixel represents time and the Y coordinate represents a corresponding frequency and the color of the pixel is the amplitude of that frequency.
