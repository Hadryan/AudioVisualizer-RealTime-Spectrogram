# RealTime-AudioVisualizer-Spectrogram
This is a small JavaFX desktop application for real-time audio visualization (spectrogram) built from scratch.

## Overview
The application supports visualization and playback of .wav files, or it can directly visualize microphone input.
<br>The audio is visually represented with a spectrogram. A spectrogram is a picture where the X coordinate of a pixel represents time, the Y coordinate represents a corresponding frequency and the color of the pixel is the amplitude of that frequency.

## Sidenote
This was a fun little project I had done in my spare time at the start of the 5th semester (start of the 3rd year of collage), influenced by studying audio processing for the course - Speech recognition at the Faculty of Computer Science in Belgrade.

## Download
You can download the .jar files [here](downloads).<br>
To run the AudioVisualizerSpectrogramPlayer.jar it must be within the same folder as the audioFiles folder.
